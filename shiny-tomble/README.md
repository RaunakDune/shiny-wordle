# Shiny Wordle

An implementation of the popular game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), written in R using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), but using a subset of words inspired by The Locked Tomb series from Tamsyn Muir.

Adapted from the [RStudio Shiny tutorial by Winston Chang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quvz4xLbW88&feature=youtu.be).

The wordlist was compiled by CactusKid and Bree in The People's Tomb discord server. Many thanks!
